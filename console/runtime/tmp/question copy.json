However, the article does not directly state that increasing pay will lead to high work motivation. On the contrary, it points out that sometimes a thank-you letter can inspire motivation more than monetary rewards. This suggests that monetary rewards are not the only or most effective form of motivation.

Paragraph C explicitly compares the suitability of new leaves and old leaves for howler monkeys. The text points out that leaves growing in regenerating forests (new leaves) are more suitable for howler monkeys than leaves produced by undisturbed century-old trees (old leaves). The reason is that young forest trees allocate most of their energy to growing wood, leaves, and fruits, resulting in lower levels of toxins, which makes new leaves more suitable for howler monkeys to consume.

    "analyze_en": "To find the correct answer, we need to focus on the key information in the question: \"howler monkey's flexibility\" and \"segmented habitat.\" In paragraph D, we can find content that directly corresponds to these concepts. The text mentions that howler monkeys are more \"resilient\" than other monkeys, which corresponds to \"flexibility\" in the question. At the same time, the article clearly states that howler monkeys can survive in a \"small home range,\" while spider monkeys cannot survive in a \"fragmented habitat,\" which directly corresponds to \"segmented habitat\" in the question. This information clearly indicates that paragraph D provides the advantages of howler monkeys' flexible survival in fragmented habitats, thus making it the correct answer.",

    "analyze_en": "This question assesses the ability to understand the natural phenomena described in the article and their causal relationships. The answer sentence explains the process by which newly formed sea ice is blown away by the wind, leading to the remaining water becoming saltier and denser, ultimately overflowing the continental shelf. This process illustrates that it is the phenomenon of newly formed sea ice being brought into the ocean that drives the Antarctic water to flow beyond the continental shelf. Therefore, option C \"Bringing fresh ice into the oceans\" is the correct answer, as it most accurately summarizes this driving factor.",

The key lies in understanding how the original text describes the changes in the coastline. The article mentions \"constant reconfiguration of the coastline,\" where \"constant\" contrasts with \"periodically\" in the question stem. \"Constant\" indicates that the changes are continuous and not periodic. Therefore, the original text is actually contrary to the statement in the question. Additionally, the article states \"we know little about,\" indicating that our understanding of the changes in the coastline is limited. This further suggests that it is impossible to determine if the changes are periodic. Based on this information, we can conclude that the statement in the question is false (FALSE). When tackling such questions, it is important to carefully compare the wording of the original text with the statement in the question, especially the differences in the meanings of key terms.",

First, we need to look for information related to \"cherish\" and \"water scarcity\" in the article.\n\n        After reading the entire text, we find that the article mainly discusses the current situation, causes, impacts, and possible solutions to water scarcity. However, the article does not directly mention whether people cherish the use of water resources.\n\n        The article does mention the severity of water scarcity, for example: \"Today, one in six people, over 1 billion, lack sufficient safe freshwater,\" and \"By the middle of this century, as much as three-quarters of the world's population may face freshwater shortages.\" This information emphasizes the importance of the water resource issue but does not comment on people's attitudes towards the use of water resources.\n\n        Additionally, the article discusses some policies and technical measures to address water scarcity, such as \"Governments and authorities at all levels must develop and implement plans, and adopt political, economic, and technical measures to ensure water security now and in the coming decades.\" This indicates that the relevant departments recognize the seriousness of the problem, but it still does not directly mention whether ordinary people cherish water resources.\n\n        Since the article does not explicitly mention whether people cherish the use of water resources, we cannot determine whether the statement in the question is true or false. Therefore, the correct answer should be \"NOT GIVEN.\"\n\n        This question reminds us that when answering reading comprehension questions, we must strictly base our answers on the content of the article and not make judgments based on our own common sense or assumptions.

    "analyze_en": "This question asks us to identify the title of the book written by Aristotle on the art of storytelling. First, we need to locate information related to Aristotle and the art of storytelling in the article. In paragraph F, we found a description of Aristotle. The text mentions that he \"left some incomplete lecture notes on the art of telling stories,\" which corresponds to \"wrote a book on the art of storytelling\" in the question. Next, we need to find the name of this book. In the same sentence, we see \"a slim volume known as The Poetics.\" Here, \"known as\" is synonymous with \"called\" in the question. Therefore, we can conclude that the answer is \"The Poetics.\" It is important to note that although the question asks for a single word, \"The Poetics\" is a proper noun and should be written in full.",

The key is to find information in the original text that corresponds to the question. The article mentions, \"One hundred years ago, environmental experts predicted that in the 21st century there would be a shortage of water and silence.\" This sentence is highly consistent with the content of the question. Here, \"environmental experts predicted\" corresponds to \"Experts forecasted\" in the question; \"shortage of water and silence\" actually describes the issues of water scarcity and noise pollution; \"in the 21st century\" corresponds to \"future problems\" in the question. Although the original text uses \"silence\" instead of directly saying \"noise pollution,\" the lack of quiet actually implies the existence of noise pollution. Therefore, we can confirm that the original text does indeed contain the information described in the question, and the answer should be TRUE.",

It notes that there is disagreement among experts regarding the definition of intelligence, with some believing that certain types of intelligence in Gardner's theory are more akin to personality traits rather than cognitive abilities.

Spence, a professor at the school of medicine at the University of Sheffield in England, performed brain scans that showed that a woman convicted of poisoning a child in her care appeared to be telling the truth when she denied committing the crime.\"\n\n        This sentence contains several important pieces of information:\n        1. Lie detection: The article mentions \"performed brain scans,\" which is a method of lie detection.\n        2. Convicted woman: The article mentions \"a woman convicted of poisoning a child.\"\n        3. Europe: The article mentions \"University of Sheffield in England,\" and England is a European country.\n\n        Although the article does not explicitly state that this is the \"first\" study conducted, it is the first such study mentioned in the article, and there is no mention of similar studies conducted elsewhere earlier. Therefore, we can infer that this is likely the first study conducted.\n\n        In summary, the information in the article is consistent with the statement in the question, so the answer is TRUE.",

Although the original text uses \"almost one hundred,\" considering the meaning of \"almost,\" we can understand that the number of words Alex can pronounce is slightly less than 100.

    "analyze_en": "This question requires us to find a word in the article that describes the complex situations that may arise when reacting to others. We need to focus on two key points: the factors that lead to complex situations and the context of interacting with others.\n\nIn the article, we can find the following sentence: \"Pressure from other managers, senior staff or even employees can cause those in middle management to make decisions based quickly, reacting at speed to a problem that would have been better solved by a calmer, more inclusive style of management.\"\n\nThe word \"Pressure\" in this sentence is exactly the answer we are looking for. It meets the following criteria of the question:\n\n1. It is a single word.\n2. It describes the context of interacting with others (from other managers, senior staff, and regular employees).\n3. It leads to complex situations (making quick decisions instead of adopting a calmer, more inclusive approach).\n\nTherefore, \"pressure\" is the most appropriate answer. It not only meets the grammatical form required by the question (a single word) but also accurately describes the factors that may lead to complex situations when interacting with others.",

The article mentions a \"ladder\" of decision-making, which includes several steps: programming, beliefs, feelings, attitudes, and actions. The key is to find the concept that is closest to \"personally held beliefs.\"\n\n    The article states: \"for someone to believe something does not necessarily mean it is true,\" which corresponds to \"not necessarily universally\" in the question. Next, the article points out that the next step is \"our feelings,\" explaining it as \"how we personally react to an issue.\" This description is very close to \"personally held beliefs\" in the question.\n\n    Therefore, \"feelings\" is the most appropriate answer. It aligns with the personal level description and is the next stage after \"beliefs,\" matching the requirement of \"possibly only personally held beliefs, not necessarily universally.\"",

    "analyze_en": "This question assesses students' understanding of the five filters in the decision-making process proposed by Anne Wicks. The article describes these five filters: Programming, Beliefs, Feelings, Attitudes, and Actions. When describing Attitudes, the article specifically mentions the word \"mood.\"\n\nTo find the correct answer, we need to carefully read the theoretical section by Anne Wicks, especially the description of Attitudes. The article states that Attitudes include not only those that are difficult to change but also the variations in our daily feelings, that is, our mood. The term \"mood\" is explicitly used here, which aligns perfectly with the requirements of the question.\n\nWhen students answer such questions, they should pay attention to the following points:\n1. Read the entire paragraph carefully, not just focus on individual words.\n2. Note that the question requires specific terms, not broader concepts.\n3. Understand the logical structure of the article, especially the theoretical framework proposed by the author.\n4. Be aware of the use of synonyms or near-synonyms; sometimes the answer may not appear directly in the article but may be presented in the form of synonyms.\n\nBy using this method, we can accurately pinpoint the answer \"Mood,\" which not only meets the requirements of the question but also has a clear correspondence in the article.",

    "analyze_en": "This question requires us to determine whether cockroaches live longer than many other insects. First, we need to look for information related to the lifespan of cockroaches in the article. The keywords are \"live longer\" and \"insects.\"\n\n        In the article, we found a sentence that states: \"with the insect's relatively long lifespan (about a year).\" Here, \"relatively long lifespan\" is key. The word \"relatively\" suggests a comparison with other insects, while \"long\" directly corresponds to \"longer\" in the question.\n\n        Although the article does not explicitly list the lifespans of other insects for comparison, the use of the phrase \"relatively long\" is sufficient to indicate that the lifespan of cockroaches is longer than that of typical insects. This kind of relative comparison is common in reading comprehension questions, and we need to learn to infer implicit information from such expressions.\n\n        Additionally, the article mentions that cockroaches can produce 300 to 400 offspring during their one-year lifespan, which further emphasizes the length of their lifespan.\n\n        Therefore, even though the article does not directly provide a comparison, we can infer from the phrase \"relatively long lifespan\" that cockroaches indeed live longer than many other insects, so the answer is TRUE.\n\n        For this type of judgment question, we need to pay attention to:\n        1. Looking for synonymous expressions or near-synonyms of the keywords in the question.\n        2. Noticing words that imply comparison, such as \"relatively.\"\n        3. Learning to infer implicit information from the context.\n        4. Not expecting the article to always provide clear comparisons; sometimes we need to make reasonable inferences ourselves.",

The question stem mentions that offenders may be encouraged to participate in deciding their punishment, but the original text does not directly support this statement. Instead, the original text describes the judge encouraging offenders to participate in formulating a relapse prevention plan, which is a step towards obtaining probation.\n\nWe need to pay attention to the following points:\n1. The original text mentions \"probation,\" not \"punishment.\"\n2. The judge asks the offenders to propose a relapse prevention plan to discuss whether to grant probation, rather than to decide on punishment.\n3. Although offenders are encouraged to participate in this process, they are not deciding their own punishment.\n\nTherefore, the statement in the question stem cannot be directly supported by the original text, and the answer should be FALSE.

Therefore, we cannot determine whether almost all children needed to attend school full-time throughout the entire 20th century.\n\nSince the original text does not provide enough information to directly support or refute the statement in the question stem, the correct answer should be \"NOT GIVEN.\" This reminds us to pay attention to distinguishing between explicitly stated information in the text and possible inferences when answering reading comprehension questions, and not to overinterpret the content of the article.",

First, we need to locate information related to \"toxic algae\" and \"spreading around the world\" in the article.

Note that while \"ballast water\" is also a medium of spread, the question asks for the method of spread, not the specific medium.

We need to look for information about the number of prey under different tree species in the article.\n\nThe article mentions several types of trees: piquia, copaiba, and uxi. We need to compare the number of prey under these trees:\n\n1. Piquia tree: captured five types of prey, with a total weight of 232 kilograms.\n2. Copaiba tree: captured two types of prey, with a total weight of 63 kilograms.\n3. Uxi tree: captured four types of prey, with a total weight of 38 kilograms.\n\nComparing this data, we can find that the copaiba tree has the least number of captured prey species (only two). Therefore, the answer for blank 35 should be \"copaiba.\"\n\nFor blank 36, the question asks for \"yield.\" In the same sentence, we can see that the prey weight under the uxi tree is the lightest, at only 38 kilograms. Therefore, the answer for blank 36 should be \"fibre\" (the lowest).\n\nThis question tests the candidate's ability to grasp detailed information and their ability to compare and analyze different data.

The article states that if a person is in a \"handicapped\" position due to having a happy childhood, then they need to practice a positive optimistic attitude to enhance their resilience. This suggests that those with a happy childhood may have difficulties in practicing optimism.\n\nThe phrase \"might not be able to practise optimism\" in the question stem is consistent with the expression in the original text. The original text uses the word \"handicapped,\" indicating that those with a happy childhood may be at a disadvantage in certain aspects and require extra effort to practice optimism.\n\nTherefore, the original text supports the viewpoint in the question stem that individuals with a happy childhood may find it less easy to practice optimism.

The key is to find expressions in the article that correspond to \"all kinds of music\" and \"enhance one's brain performance.\"\n\n        In paragraph E, we find the key sentence: \"just listening to music strengthens connections used in higher-order thinking.\" Here, \"just listening to music\" does not specify a particular kind of music and can be understood to include all types of music. \"Strengthens connections used in higher-order thinking\" corresponds to \"enhance one's brain performance\" in the question stem, indicating that music can enhance brain function.\n\n        Additionally, the paragraph mentions, \"Listening to music can then be thought of as 'exercise' for the brain, improving concentration and enhancing intuition,\" further supporting the positive impact of music on brain performance.\n\n        Although the article does not explicitly use the phrase \"all kinds of music,\" the expression \"just listening to music\" is broad enough to be understood as including all types of music. Therefore, we can conclude that the information in the question stem is supported by the article, and the answer should be TRUE.\n\n        It is important to note that the article mainly discusses the effects of Mozart's music, but in this key paragraph, the author uses a more general expression, suggesting that this effect may apply to various kinds of music.

The last paragraph of the original text mentions that contemporary children's literature is recommended for both adult and child readers, reflecting a 19th-century perspective that children's literature can be shared across different generations. This viewpoint differs from the statement in the question stem that \"today's children's book authors believe their works should appeal to both children and adults.\"\n\nThe original text emphasizes that the works are recommended for two groups, rather than being an intentional act by the authors. Furthermore, the original text describes this practice as a response to the 19th-century viewpoint, rather than a proactive belief of modern authors. This subtle distinction indicates that the statement in the question stem is not entirely consistent with the information provided in the original text.\n\nTherefore, we cannot say that the statement in the question stem is directly supported by the article. On the contrary, the information provided in the original text actually differs from the statement in the question stem, suggesting that this statement is incorrect.
